## Project Description
This project was developed for Udacity's Fullstack Developer degree program. It is an item catalog application, my own mock
representation of what a personal electronics store would have as a website. The website demonstrates CRUD operations,
OAuth 2.0 authentication, mobile responsiveness, HTML/CSS trickery. and more!

## Getting Started
To test and use the application, clone this github.

The project involves the following library dependencies:
* Flask
* sqlalchemy
* OAuth 2.0
* httplib2
* JSON
* requests

Upon installing any missing dependencies, cd into the project directory and run python3 backend.py in the terminal. Open a browser window, and type http://localhost:8000 into the browser's address bar.

From there, the application will show itself! To use the administrative functions, a Google sign-in button is present on the main page of the application. Simply sign in to a gmail account to add, edit, or delete categories or items.
