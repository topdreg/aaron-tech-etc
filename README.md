## Project Description
This project was developed for Udacity's Fullstack Developer degree program. It is an item catalog application, my own mock
representation of what a personal electronics store would have as a website. The website demonstrates CRUD operations,
OAuth 2.0 authentication, mobile responsiveness, HTML/CSS trickery. and more!
